# Adonis / Vite / Inertia / Vue Boilerplate

Based on the example in [91codes' adonis-vite repo](https://github.com/91codes/adonis-vite), this is a boilerplate setup for using AdonisJS as a backend, with Vue as a frontend using Inertia to remove the need for an API, along with Vite for compiling resources and hot reloading.
